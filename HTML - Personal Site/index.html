  <h3>PERSONAL PROFILE</h3>

  <p>I am a recent graduate with a 2:1 degree in Criminal Justice Studies from the
    University of Bradford. Through this degree I have been able to develop and excellent
    eye for detaildue to heavy demands of assignment and research. As a result, I
    am also able to work under pressure, having had to balance my education workload
    with my part time job in retail.<br /> With my current role as a Case Handler in the
    Lloyds Banking Group, I have been able to increase my professionalism in the
    workplace - this role relied on me having to use my own initiative with the decisions
    I would have to make with handeling each case. <br />This is a fast, ever changing environment,
    resulting in having to become a strong team player and working with minimal supervision.
    I am looking for a challenging, fast-paced environment to utilise my knowledge and
    develop my creative skill set further.
